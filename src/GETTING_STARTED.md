## ‚ùì Common Questions

### Q: Can I use this without admin mode?
**A:** Yes! Regular users can:
- View all subjects and groups
- Join available groups
- Assign representatives
- Remove themselves from groups (if not locked)

They CANNOT:
- Create/edit/delete subjects
- Add/remove students
- Create groupings or groups
- Lock/unlock groupings
- Delete anything

---

### Q: What happens if I delete a subject?
**A:** Everything under it is deleted:
- All students enrolled in that subject
- All groupings in that subject
- All groups in those groupings
- All members in those groups

This is automatic (cascade delete). Be careful!

---

### Q: Can I use real student names?
**A:** You CAN, but remember:
- This is a prototype/school project tool
- Don't store sensitive info (grades, contact info)
- For production use, add authentication
- Check your school's privacy policies

---

### Q: What if I run out of free tier?
**A:** Unlikely! Free tier includes:
- 500MB database (you'll use <1%)
- 1GB bandwidth/month (plenty for 100+ users)
- 2 million edge function calls

For a school project, you won't hit limits.

---

### Q: Can multiple admins exist?
**A:** Currently, anyone who knows the password can access admin mode.

**Admin Password:** `wer124SantosPogi`

To change the password, edit `/components/Navbar.tsx` and update the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` constant.

For production, you'd want to:
1. Add user authentication
2. Store admin status in database
3. Only show toggle to actual admins
4. Enforce with database policies

---

### Q: What's the name format requirement?
**A:** Must be: `Last Name, First Name`

Examples:
- ‚úÖ `Santos, Roi Aldrich`
- ‚úÖ `Chen, Alice`
- ‚úÖ `Smith-Jones, Mary Jane`
- ‚ùå `Roi Santos` (reversed)
- ‚ùå `Santos,Roi` (no space after comma)
- ‚ùå `santos, roi` (should be capitalized)

---

### Q: Can I change the name format?
**A:** Yes! Edit `/components/GroupCard.tsx`:

```typescript
// Find this function:
const validateNameFormat = (name: string): boolean => {
  const regex = /^[A-Za-z\s]+,\s*[A-Za-z\s]+$/;
  return regex.test(name.trim());
};

// Change to allow any format:
const validateNameFormat = (name: string): boolean => {
  return name.trim().length > 0; // Just check not empty
};
```

---

### Q: How do I remove sample data?
**A:** In Supabase SQL Editor, run:

```sql
DELETE FROM group_members;
DELETE FROM groups;
DELETE FROM groupings;
DELETE FROM students;
DELETE FROM subjects;
```

Then create your own subjects!

---

### Q: Can I add more fields (email, phone, etc.)?
**A:** Yes, but requires database changes:

1. Add column in Supabase:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email TEXT;
   ```

2. Update TypeScript types in `/utils/supabase/client.ts`

3. Update forms to include new field

4. Update database.ts functions to save new field

Better for learning: Keep it simple first!
