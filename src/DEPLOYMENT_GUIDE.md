## 🔧 Step 1: Prepare Your Code

### 1.1 Test Local Build

Make sure your app builds correctly:

```bash
# Run build command
npm run build

# You should see:
# ✓ built in XXXms
# dist folder created
```

**Expected output:**
```
vite v5.x.x building for production...
✓ XXX modules transformed.
dist/index.html                  X.XX kB
dist/assets/index-XXXXX.js      XXX.XX kB
✓ built in XXXms
```

**If errors occur:**
- Fix TypeScript errors first
- Check import statements
- Verify all files exist

---

### 1.2 Preview Build Locally

Test that the built app works:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Open `http://localhost:4173` and test:
- ✅ App loads
- ✅ Data loads from Supabase
- ✅ Can navigate pages
- ✅ No console errors

**Stop the preview:** Press Ctrl+C

---

## 🐙 Step 2: Push to GitHub

### 2.1 Create GitHub Repository

**If you haven't already:**

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Sign in (or create account)
3. Click "+" → "New repository"
4. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `groupings-tracker`
   - **Description:** "A group management system for students"
   - **Visibility:** Public or Private (your choice)
   - **Initialize:** Leave unchecked (we have code already)
5. Click "Create repository"

---

### 2.2 Initialize Git Locally

In your project folder:

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - Groupings Tracker with Supabase"

# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Verify:**
- Refresh your GitHub repository page
- You should see all your files

---

### 2.3 Create .gitignore (If Needed)

Make sure you're not committing sensitive files:

```bash
# Create/edit .gitignore file
node_modules/
dist/
.DS_Store
.env
.env.local
*.log
```

**Note:** Supabase credentials are in `/utils/supabase/info.tsx` which is safe to commit (they're public keys).

---

## ☁️ Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

### 3.1 Create Vercel Account

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Sign Up"

---

### 3.2 Import Project

1. In Vercel dashboard, click "Add New..." → "Project"
2. You'll see your GitHub repositories
3. Find "groupings-tracker"
4. Click "Import"

---

### 3.3 Configure Project

Vercel should auto-detect everything, but verify:

**Framework Preset:**
- Should auto-detect: "Vite"
- If not, select "Vite" from dropdown

**Root Directory:**
- Leave as: `./`

**Build Command:**
- Should be: `npm run build`
- (or `vite build`)

**Output Directory:**

---

### 3.4 Deploy!

1. Review settings one more time
2. Click **"Deploy"**
3. Watch the build logs (exciting! 🍿)
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

**You'll see:**
```

4. Verify forms work
5. Check everything is readable

---

## 🎨 Step 5: Customize Deployment

### 5.1 Custom Domain (Optional)

Want `groupings.yourschool.com` instead of Vercel subdomain?

1. Buy domain (Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
2. In Vercel project → "Settings" → "Domains"
3. Add your domain
4. Follow DNS instructions
5. Wait for propagation (5-30 minutes)

---

### 5.2 Environment Variables

If you need to add/change environment variables:

1. In Vercel project → "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
2. Add variable
3. Redeploy to apply changes

**Note:** Supabase vars are already set via Figma Make.

---

### 5.3 Enable Analytics

Track usage for free:

1. In Vercel project → "Analytics"
2. Click "Enable"
3. See page views, top pages, etc.

---

## 🔄 Step 6: Set Up Auto-Deployment

### 6.1 How It Works

Every time you push to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploys!

```
1. Make code changes locally
   ↓
2. git add .
   git commit -m "Added new feature"
   git push
   ↓
3. Vercel detects push
   ↓
4. Vercel builds & deploys
   ↓
5. New version live in ~2 minutes!
```

---

### 6.2 Test Auto-Deploy

Let's try it:

1. **Edit something small** - like app title:
   ```tsx
   // In /components/Navbar.tsx
   <h1>Groupings Tracker v2</h1>
   ```

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated app title"
   git push
   ```

3. **Watch Vercel:**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Click your project
   - See "Building..." notification
   - Wait ~2 minutes
   - Visit your URL
   - See the change!

---

### 6.3 Deployment Notifications

Get notified about deployments:

1. Vercel → Project → "Settings" → "Notifications"
2. Enable email notifications
3. Or connect to Slack/Discord

---

## 📊 Step 7: Monitor Your App

### 7.1 Vercel Analytics

Monitor traffic:
1. Vercel → Project → "Analytics"
2. See:
   - Page views
   - Top pages
   - Visitor countries
   - Device types

---

### 7.2 Vercel Logs

Debug issues:
1. Vercel → Project → "Deployments"
2. Click a deployment
3. Click "Functions" tab
4. See runtime logs
5. Find errors here

---

### 7.3 Supabase Usage

Monitor database:
1. Supabase → Project → "Settings" → "Usage"
2. Check:
   - Database size
   - Bandwidth
   - Active connections
3. Set up billing alerts

---

## 🎉 You're Live!

Congratulations! Your app is now:
- ✅ Live on the internet
- ✅ Accessible from anywhere
- ✅ Multi-user ready
- ✅ Auto-deploying
- ✅ Free to use

---

## 📢 Step 8: Share with Users

### 8.1 Share the URL

Send to your team/classmates:

**Email template:**
```
Hi everyone!

Our group management system is now live!

URL: https://your-app.vercel.app

How to use:
1. Visit the URL
2. Click on your subject
3. Click on a grouping
4. Click "Join Group"
5. Enter your name as: Last, First (e.g., Smith, John)

Questions? Contact [your-name]

Thanks!
```

---

### 8.2 Create User Guide

Post instructions somewhere accessible:

**Quick Start for Users:**
1. Go to [your URL]
2. Browse subjects and groupings
3. Join groups (when available)
4. Names must be: "Last, First"
5. Contact admin for: new subjects, locked groups

---

### 8.3 Designate Admins

Decide who gets admin access:
- Teachers
- Project leads
- Designated coordinators

Tell them:
- Click shield icon (top right) to enable admin mode
- Can create/edit/delete everything
- Can lock groupings
- Be careful with delete actions!

---

## 🛠️ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

**Weekly:**
- [ ] Check Vercel deployment status
- [ ] Review error logs
- [ ] Monitor Supabase usage

**Monthly:**
- [ ] Backup database (Supabase → Database → Backups)
- [ ] Review and archive old data
- [ ] Update dependencies (`npm update`)

**As Needed:**
- [ ] Add/remove students
- [ ] Create new subjects
- [ ] Clear old groupings

---

### Updating the App

When you want to add features:

1. **Develop locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Make changes, test
   ```

2. **Test build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push
   ```

4. **Verify:**
   - Wait ~2 minutes
   - Test on production URL

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Deployments

### Build Fails

**Check build logs in Vercel:**
1. Go to failed deployment
2. Read error message
3. Common issues:
   - TypeScript errors → Fix locally first
   - Missing dependencies → Run `npm install`
   - Import errors → Check file paths

**Fix locally first:**
```bash
npm run build
# Fix any errors
# Commit & push again
```

---

### App Loads but Shows Errors

**Check browser console:**
1. F12 → Console tab
2. Look for red errors
3. Common issues:
   - Supabase connection → Check credentials
   - RLS policies → Verify in Supabase
   - API errors → Check Supabase logs

---

### Changes Not Appearing

**Possible causes:**
1. Browser cache → Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. CDN cache → Wait 5 minutes
3. Build didn't run → Check Vercel deployments
4. Wrong branch → Verify you pushed to `main`

---

### Slow Loading

**Optimize:**
1. Check network tab (F12 → Network)
2. Look for large files
3. Optimize images (compress/resize)
4. Enable Vercel Image Optimization
5. Consider lazy loading

---

## 📈 Scaling Up

### When You Grow

**10-50 users:** Current setup is perfect ✅

**50-100 users:**
- Add caching (React Query)
- Monitor Supabase usage more closely
- Consider pagination for large lists

**100+ users:**
- Upgrade Supabase plan (if needed)
- Add real-time subscriptions
- Implement search/filtering
- Add analytics

**1000+ users:**
- Definitely upgrade Supabase
- Add CDN for assets
- Implement proper caching
- Consider professional support

---

## 🔐 Security Hardening (Production)

For serious production use:

### Add Authentication
1. Enable Supabase Auth
2. Add login/signup pages
3. Restrict admin mode to specific users
4. Update RLS policies

### Add Validation
1. Server-side input validation
2. Rate limiting
3. CSRF protection
4. XSS protection (React handles most)

### Add Monitoring
1. Error tracking (Sentry)
2. Performance monitoring
3. Uptime monitoring
4. Security scanning
